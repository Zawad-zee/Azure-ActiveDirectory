Cybersec world is vast and with AI it has become more challenging. I am hopeful that in near future I will be able to build a portfolio strong enough for me to get into the the cybersec role!!

Recently came across a group of IT professionals ( different levels and sectors), they were working together to practice their knowledge in a controlled lab environment and eventually move towards cybersec role or atleast help to understand the cybersec world!! 

In the group they have been practicing pentesting tools on virtual machines and the day I joined them they moved to AD fundamentals. The lead shared his experiences and asked everyone to create a lab environment based on an assignment he did back in 2019. 

Lab scenario: Communicate between devices in 2 Wide Area Networks WAN 

Faced several blocks and obstacles on the way to solve this lab and learnt the following 
 - Hands on Learning is fun and interesting applying what you have learnt. This way it solidifies your knowledge. 
- Not to rely on gpt information, they are no doubt a great tool and makes your life easy and fast. But they are not correct all times. 

It took me around 2 hours of back-forth prompting with gpt to compile a final document which I had shared in the project repo. I tried to recall all the necessary troubleshooting steps/checks I had done during the lab and include them in the document. I have also shared my journey in the readme file of the repository.
There are short comings and might have missed out some, if the document requires an update, please feel free to reach out to me! I will greatly appreciate!!

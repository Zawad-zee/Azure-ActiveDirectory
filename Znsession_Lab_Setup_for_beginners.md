# Znsession Lab Setup: A Guided Walkthrough and Reference

This document serves as a step-by-step, beginner-friendly guide to setting up a virtual network environment. While this lab can also be performed using VMWare Workstation, which is a popular choice in professional settings, we will be using Oracle VM VirtualBox due to technical challenges encountered during the initial setup.

Additionally, for the router VM, there are two primary methods: installing a dedicated router operating system (like pfSense) or configuring a Windows Server to handle network forwarding. We attempted to use pfSense but encountered issues, so we opted to use a Windows Server machine for routing. This method is simpler to set up but does have certain limitations compared to a dedicated routing solution.

This guide explains every action we performed, from creating virtual networks to configuring servers and resolving common issues, so that a non-technical user can follow along and understand the purpose of each step. This version has been updated to include a detailed breakdown of the Domain Controller setup and replication process.

### **1. Installing the Virtual Machines**

*Why we're doing this:* Before we can build our virtual network, we first need to create the virtual computers, or "virtual machines" (VMs), that will act as our servers and client computers. Think of this as getting all the hardware ready before you can connect it all with network cables.

**WARNING**: Do not intentionally run system updates on the virtual machines (Servers or clients). At the System Tray, there will be notifications for a system update; do not run these. System updates can cause unexpected changes and may disrupt the lab environment.
#### **Step-by-Step VM Creation**

*Why we're doing this:* This process walks us through the VirtualBox wizard to create a new, blank virtual computer. We'll give it a name and tell it what operating system to prepare for.

1.  **Open VirtualBox and Click "New"**: On the main VirtualBox screen, find the `New` button and click it to start the virtual machine creation wizard.

2.  **Name the Virtual Machine and Select OS**:

    * **Name**: Give your virtual machine a descriptive name (e.g., `SERVER1A`, `ROUTERVM`, `Windows 11 Client`).

    * **Folder**: Choose where you want to save the VM's files.

    * **ISO Image**: Click the down arrow and then `Other` to browse to the Windows Server 2019 or Windows 11 `.iso` file on your computer. VirtualBox will automatically detect the OS Type and Version for you.

3.  **Hardware Allocation**:

    *Why we're doing this:* Just like a physical computer, a virtual machine needs resources like memory (RAM) and a processor (CPU) to run. We're telling VirtualBox how much of our physical computer's resources to give to this virtual one.

    * **Base Memory**: Allocate a suitable amount of RAM. For Windows Server, 2GB (2048 MB) is a good start. For Windows 11, 4GB (4096 MB) or more is recommended for better performance.

    * **Processors**: Allocate 2 or more CPU cores to the virtual machine for better speed.

4.  **Virtual Hard Disk**:

    *Why we're doing this:* This is where the virtual computer's operating system and all its files will be stored. A "dynamically allocated" disk is like a flexible lunchboxâ€”it only takes up as much space on your real hard drive as it actually needs, rather than setting aside the full 50GB right away.

    * The wizard will ask you to create a virtual hard disk. Accept the default `Create a virtual hard disk now` and click `Create`.

    * The default size of 50GB is usually sufficient for our lab.

    * Choose the `VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)` file type and `Dynamically allocated` to save space on your physical hard drive.

5.  **Finish and Start the VM**: After clicking `Finish`, you will see your new virtual machine listed. Select it and click `Start` to begin the operating system installation.

#### **OS-Specific Installation Details**

*Why we're doing this:* Once the virtual machine is created, we need to install the operating system on it. This is just like installing Windows on a brand-new physical computer. The steps are slightly different for the server and client machines.

* **Windows Server 2019**:

    * When the setup starts, choose your language and keyboard layout.

    * Click `Install now`.

    * You will be asked for a product key. You can skip this for now.

    * **Why we chose "Desktop Experience":** This version gives us a familiar graphical interface with a desktop, mouse, and menus, making it much easier to manage the server than the command-line-only version.

    * Choose the **`Desktop Experience`** version. This is the one with the graphical user interface, which is much easier for beginners to work with than the command-line-only version.

    * Accept the license terms.

    * Choose `Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)`.

    * Select the virtual hard drive you created and click `Next`.

    * The installation will begin. When it's done, you will be prompted to create an Administrator password. **Remember this password!**

* **Windows 11**:

    * **Important Note on VirtualBox Installation:** After selecting your Windows 11 ISO image, you'll see a checkbox that says "Skip Unattended Installation."
        * **Why you should check this box:** If this box is unchecked, VirtualBox will try to automate the installation process by pre-filling details like the username and password. By checking the box, you are telling VirtualBox to disable this automation and let you manually go through every installation prompt yourself, which is what we need to do for this lab.

    * When the setup starts, choose your language and keyboard layout.

    * Click `Install now`.

    * You will be asked for a product key. You can skip this.

    * Choose the version of Windows 11 you want to install (e.g., Pro, Home).

    * Accept the license terms.

    * Choose `Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)`.

    * Select the virtual hard drive and click `Next`.

    * Windows 11 will prompt you to create a user account and password during the setup process.

#### **Post-Installation Verification Steps**

*Why we're doing this:* After the operating system is installed and the virtual machine reboots, it's crucial to perform a few quick checks. This ensures the environment is properly configured from the start and helps avoid issues later on, especially when connecting to a network or domain.

1.  **Verify Region and Date/Time**: Check the region, time, and date settings on the virtual machine. It should match the host machine's settings to prevent potential errors with network time synchronization, which is important for domain communication.

2.  **Verify Windows 11 Version**: For Windows 11 clients, you must verify that the installed version is **Windows 11 Pro**. Other versions, such as Windows 11 Home or Education, cannot be joined to a corporate domain. If you find that the installed version is not Windows 11 Pro, you will need to reinstall the operating system using a different ISO image.

#### **Troubleshooting Tip: Bypassing the Windows 11 Microsoft Account Requirement**

*Why we're doing this:* This is a helpful trick to create a local account for our lab instead of being forced to sign in with a Microsoft account, which simplifies the setup process.

During the initial Windows 11 setup (OOBE), the system often requires you to sign in with a Microsoft account. If you need to create a local account or join a domain, you can bypass this in one of two ways:

1.  **Join a Domain**: On the screen that asks for your Microsoft account, you may see an option to "Join a domain instead" or something similar. This will allow you to create a local account and proceed with the setup.

2.  **Use the Command Prompt**: If the domain join option isn't available, press `SHIFT + F10` to open a Command Prompt window. Type the command `oobe\bypassnro` and press Enter. The machine will restart, and when you get to the network connectivity screen again, you will have a new option: "I don't have internet." Selecting this will let you continue with the setup and create a local user account.

### **2. Lab Environment Overview**

*Why we're doing this:* Before we start building, it's important to have a clear plan. This section outlines our goal: to create a small, realistic corporate network with different departments (network segments) and specialized computers (servers) that manage everything.

Our goal was to create a mini-corporate network inside VirtualBox. We wanted to have two separate network segments connected by a central router, with special servers called "Domain Controllers" to manage everything.

* **Network Segments:**

    *Why we're doing this:* A network segment is like a department in a company. Giving them different number ranges (IP addresses) helps us keep them separate and secure. Our goal is to connect the "branch office" to the "corporate network."

    * **`WAN1` (Corporate Network):** This is our main network with the address range `192.168.132.0` to `192.168.132.255`. This network can connect to the internet.

    * **`LAN2` (Branch Office Network):** This is a separate, private network with the address range `192.168.10.0` to `192.168.10.255`. It needs to connect to the main network through our router.

* **Virtual Machines:**

    *Why we're doing this:* These are the virtual computers we created earlier. Each one will have a specific job, just like different employees in an office.

    * **`SERVER1A` & `SERVER1B`**: These are the main servers for our domain, `znsession.com`, located on the `WAN1` network.

    * **`ROUTERVM`**: This server acts like a real-world router, connecting our two networks together and providing internet access to the `LAN2` network.

    * **`SERVER2A`**: This is a server on the `LAN2` network. Its job is to eventually become another Domain Controller to help manage that network segment.

    * **`CLIENT1A` & `CLIENT2A`**: These are two Windows 11 client machines, one for each network, that we will join to our domain.

### **3. Phase 1: VirtualBox Network Configuration**

*Why we're doing this:* Before we can turn on our virtual computers and connect them, we need to create the virtual network "cables" and "switches" inside VirtualBox. This is the foundation of our entire lab.

1.  **Creating the `WAN1` Network (NatNetwork)**

    *Why we're doing this:* The NAT network lets our virtual machines on the main network get to the internet through our physical computer's internet connection. We disabled the DHCP server because we want to manually assign IP addresses for our servers, which gives us more control and predictability.

    * Open VirtualBox.

    * In the menu, go to `File` > `Host Network Manager`.

    * Click on the `NatNetwork` tab and then click `Create`.

    * Click `Properties` for the new network.

    * **Network Name**: We named it `WAN1 NatNetwork`.

    * **Network CIDR**: We set this to `192.168.132.0/24`. This defines the range of IP addresses for this network.

    * **Gateway**: The gateway was automatically set to `192.168.132.1`. This will be the address that connects our servers to the internet.

    * **DHCP Server**: We unchecked the box to disable the DHCP server because we wanted to assign IP addresses manually for better control.

2.  **Creating the `LAN2` Network (Host-Only Adapter)**

    *Why we're doing this:* This network is "host-only," which means it's a private network that only exists between our virtual machines and our physical computer. It's like a closed-off network for our "branch office" that can't get to the internet on its own.

    * In the `Host Network Manager`, click on the `Host-only Networks` tab.

    * Click `Create` to add a new network.

    * Click `Properties` for the new network.

    * **Network Name**: We named this `LAN2 Host-Only`.

    * **Adapter Tab**: The `IPv4 Address` was set to `192.168.10.1`, and the `IPv4 Network Mask` was `255.255.255.0`. This defines our second network.

    * **DHCP Server Tab**: We disabled the DHCP server here as well.

### **4. Phase 2: Virtual Machine Setup and Initial IP Configuration**

*Why we're doing this:* Now that our networks are set up, we're giving each virtual machine a unique address (an IP address) so they can find and talk to each other. This is like giving each employee a specific phone extension.

#### **`SERVER1A` and `SERVER1B` Configuration**

*Why we're doing this:* These servers need static, unchanging IP addresses because they are important. Other machines will need to know their exact address to communicate with them, especially for the domain controllers.

* **Network Adapter**: For both servers, we went to their settings in VirtualBox, then to the `Network` section, and set Adapter 1 to `NAT Network`. We then selected the `WAN1 NatNetwork` we created.

* **IP Configuration (Static)**:

    1.  On each server, we opened `Control Panel` > `Network and Sharing Center` > `Change adapter settings`.

    2.  We right-clicked the network adapter, chose `Properties`, and then double-clicked `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)`.

    3.  **For `SERVER1A`**: We entered **IP address `192.168.132.130`**, Subnet mask `255.255.255.0`, and **Default gateway `192.168.132.1`**. We set the **Preferred DNS server to `192.168.132.130`** (itself) and the **Alternate DNS server to `192.168.132.131`** (the other DC).

    4.  **For `SERVER1B`**: We did the same, but with **IP address `192.168.132.131`**, and the DNS servers pointing to `192.168.132.131` (itself) and `192.168.132.130` (the other DC).

#### **`ROUTERVM` Configuration**

*Why we're doing this:* Our router needs two addresses, one for each network it connects. The first address lets it communicate with the main network and the internet, while the second address lets it talk to the "branch office" network.

* **Network Adapter 1 (WAN1)**: We set this adapter to the `WAN1 NatNetwork`.

    * **IP Configuration**: We set the static IP to `192.168.132.100`, Gateway to `192.168.132.1`, and DNS to a public server like `8.8.8.8`.

* **Network Adapter 2 (LAN2)**: We set this adapter to the `LAN2 Host-Only` network.

    * **IP Configuration**: We set the static IP to `192.168.10.1`, but we **left the Default Gateway blank**. This is because this server itself is the gateway for this network. We also set its DNS to `8.8.8.8`.

#### **`SERVER2A` Configuration**

*Why we're doing this:* This server is on the "branch office" network. Its address will be on that network's range, and its gateway will be the router's address so it can communicate with the main network and the internet.

* **Network Adapter**: We connected this VM to the `LAN2 Host-Only` adapter.

* **IP Configuration (Static)**:

    * We set its static IP to `192.168.10.132`.

    * **Default Gateway**: This was set to `192.168.10.1`, which is the IP of `ROUTERVM`'s LAN2 network card.

    * **Preferred DNS**: This was set to `192.168.132.130` (`SERVER1A`).

    * **Alternate DNS**: This was set to `192.168.132.131` (`SERVER1B`).

#### **Windows 11 Client Configuration**

*Why we're doing this:* Our client machines are the "end users" of our network. We'll give them IP addresses and tell them where to find our domain controllers so they can eventually join the company's network.

* **`CLIENT1A` (on the WAN1 network)**

    * **Network Adapter**: Set Adapter 1 to `NAT Network` and select the `WAN1 NatNetwork`.

    * **IP Configuration**:

        1.  On the Windows 11 desktop, right-click the network icon in the bottom-right corner and select `Open Network & Internet settings`.

        2.  Click on `Ethernet` and then `Edit` next to IP assignment.

        3.  Set it to **`Manual`**.

        4.  Toggle on `IPv4`.

        5.  **IP address**: `192.168.132.200`

        6.  **Subnet mask**: `255.255.255.0`

        7.  **Gateway**: `192.168.132.1`

        8.  **Preferred DNS**: `192.168.132.130` (our primary domain controller)

        9.  **Alternate DNS**: `192.168.132.131` (our secondary domain controller)
           *This client will now be able to communicate with the servers on the main network.*

* **`CLIENT2A` (on the LAN2 network)**

    * **Network Adapter**: Set Adapter 1 to `Host-only Adapter` and select the `LAN2 Host-Only` network.

    * **IP Configuration**:

        1.  Follow the same steps as above to get to the IP assignment settings.

        2.  Set it to **`Manual`**.

        3.  Toggle on `IPv4`.

        4.  **IP address**: `192.168.10.200`

        5.  **Subnet mask**: `255.255.255.0`

        6.  **Gateway**: `192.168.10.1` (the router's address on this network)

        7.  **Preferred DNS**: `192.168.132.130` (our primary domain controller on the other network)

        8.  **Alternate DNS**: `192.168.132.131` (our secondary domain controller on the other network)
           *This client can now reach the servers and the internet through the `ROUTERVM`.*

### **5. Phase 3: Core Server Role Installation**

*Why we're doing this:* A Windows Server can do many jobs. By installing a "role," we are telling the server what its primary function will be. This is where we turn our generic servers into specialized network tools.

1.  **Installing and Configuring RRAS on `ROUTERVM`**:

    *Why we're doing this:* RRAS stands for Routing and Remote Access Service. We need to install this role to tell our Windows Server to act as a router. This role will allow it to forward traffic between our two separate network segments and share its internet connection.

    * We opened `Server Manager`, clicked `Add Roles and Features`, and installed `Network Policy and Access Services`.

    * After installation, we opened `Routing and Remote Access` from the `Tools` menu.

    * We right-clicked the server name and chose `Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access`.

    * In the wizard, we selected `Network address translation (NAT)` and chose our `WAN1` interface (`192.168.132.100`) as the public interface. This told the router to share its internet connection with the `LAN2` network.

2.  **Detailed Steps to Promote `SERVER1A` and `SERVER1B` to Domain Controllers**:

    *Why we're doing this:* A "Domain Controller" is the most important server in a corporate network. It acts as a central phonebook and security guard, managing all the users, computers, and access rights for the entire network. The "forest" is the top-level container for our entire corporate domain (`znsession.com`).

    * **Install the AD DS Role**:

        1.  On `SERVER1A` (or `SERVER1B`), open `Server Manager` and click `Add Roles and Features`.

        2.  Click `Next` until you get to the `Server Roles` screen.

        3.  Check the box next to `Active Directory Domain Services`. When prompted to add the required management features, click `Add Features`.

        4.  Click `Next` through the remaining screens and then `Install`.

    * **Promote the Server to a DC**:

        1.  After the role installation is complete, a yellow notification flag will appear in `Server Manager`. Click the flag and then click `Promote this server to a domain controller`.

        2.  In the wizard, select the option **`Add a new forest`**. This is because `znsession.com` is a brand-new domain.

        3.  For the `Root domain name`, enter **`znsession.com`**.

        4.  Click `Next`.

        5.  On the `Domain Controller Options` screen, check the boxes for `Domain Name System (DNS) server` and `Global Catalog (GC)`.

        6.  For the `Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)` password, enter a strong password (and remember it!). This password is used for a special recovery mode.

        7.  Click `Next` through the remaining wizard pages, accepting the default options.

        8.  Click `Install` to begin the promotion process. The server will restart automatically.

    * **Adding the Second DC (`SERVER1B`)**: We repeated these steps on `SERVER1B` but with one key difference. In the promotion wizard, we selected **`Add a domain controller to an existing domain`** and specified `znsession.com` and the credentials of the domain administrator we just created.

#### **Joining and Promoting `SERVER2A`**

*Why we're doing this:* We are adding this server to our `znsession.com` domain so it can also become a domain controller. Having more than one domain controller is like having a backup; if one goes down, the network can still be managed by the others.

* **Once the initial domain controllers are set up**, we were ready to join `SERVER2A` to the domain.

    1.  We logged into `SERVER2A` and, in `Server Manager` > `Local Server`, we clicked the `Workgroup` link.

    2.  We clicked `Change...`, selected `Domain`, and typed `znsession.com`.

    3.  After providing the `znsession.com` Administrator password, `SERVER2A` joined the domain and restarted.

    4.  We then installed the `Active Directory Domain Services` role and promoted `SERVER2A` to be an additional Domain Controller.

    5.  **Verification**: After `SERVER2A` has restarted, log into `SERVER1A` (or `SERVER1B`), open `Active Directory Users and Computers`, and expand the `Domain Controllers` organizational unit. `SERVER2A` should be listed here, confirming its successful promotion.


#### **Joining Client Machines to the Domain**

*Why we're doing this:* This is the final step to integrate our client computers into the corporate network. By joining the domain, these computers will now be managed by our domain controllers, and users can log in with a single company account.

### **Pre-joining Checklist**

Before you attempt to join a client machine to the domain, please ensure the following:

1.  **Domain Controllers are Running**: Verify that `SERVER1A` and `SERVER1B` are powered on and running. The client machine needs to be able to communicate with the domain controllers to complete the joining process.
2.  **Client Network Connectivity**: Check the network icon in the system tray (bottom-right corner) of the client machine. It should show that the machine is connected to the network. If there is a warning sign (e.g., a globe icon with a red X), it indicates a network connectivity issue that needs to be resolved first.

* **`CLIENT1A` (on the WAN1 network)**

    1.  On `CLIENT1A`, right-click the Start menu and select `System`.

    2.  Under `Device specifications`, click `Rename this PC (Advanced)`.

    3.  In the `System Properties` window, click the `Change...` button.

    4.  Under `Member of`, select `Domain` and type `znsession.com`.

    5.  Enter the credentials for the domain administrator when prompted and click `OK`.

    6.  The computer will prompt you to restart. Click `Restart Now`.

* **`CLIENT2A` (on the LAN2 network)**

    1.  Follow the same steps as for `CLIENT1A`. The DNS settings we configured earlier will allow it to find the domain controllers.

**After Client machines restart** you will need to log in using the credentials of a user that has been created in the domain controllers. The credentials are provided by the admins. If no users are created, you may create a new test user in the ADUC of the Domain Controller or use the default Administrator credentials to log in. The login format is:
Username field: `Domain\username`
Password field: `password` for the account

* **Verification**:

    1.  Log into `SERVER1A` (or `SERVER1B`).

    2.  Open `Active Directory Users and Computers` (ADUC).

    3.  Expand the `znsession.com` domain and navigate to the `Computers` organizational unit.

    4.  Both `CLIENT1A` and `CLIENT2A` should be listed here, confirming they have successfully joined the domain.

### **3. Verifying and Testing Active Directory Replication**:

*Why we're doing this:* "Replication" is the process of making sure that any changes made on one domain controller (like creating a new user on `SERVER1A`) are automatically copied over to all the other domain controllers (like `SERVER1B` and `SERVER2A`). We need to test this to ensure our backups are working.

* **Check AD Replication Status**:

    1.  On `SERVER1A`, open `Command Prompt` as an Administrator.

    2.  Run the command: `repadmin /showrepl`

    3.  This command will show the status of Active Directory replication between `SERVER1A` and `SERVER1B`. You should see `SUCCESSFUL` for both servers.

* **Test AD Object Replication**:

    1.  On `SERVER1A`, open `Active Directory Users and Computers` (ADUC).

    2.  Create a new test user or group.

    3.  On `SERVER1B`, open ADUC and refresh the view. The new user or group should appear, confirming that the replication is working correctly.

* **Test DNS Replication**:

    1.  On `SERVER1A`, open `DNS Manager`.

    2.  Expand `Forward Lookup Zones` > `znsession.com`.

    3.  Create a new Host (A) record (e.g., `testpc.znsession.com` pointing to `192.168.10.200`).

    4.  On `SERVER1B`, open `DNS Manager` and refresh the `znsession.com` zone. The new A record should appear, confirming DNS zone replication.

### **6. Phase 4: Final Verification and Conclusion**

*Why we're doing this:* This is the final quality check for our virtual network. We are making sure that every computer can talk to every other computer, access the internet, and find our company's domain controllers. This confirms that all our hard work has paid off and the network is working as planned.

To confirm everything was working, we did one final round of tests.

* **Test Ping Connectivity Between All Machines**: A fundamental test for any network is to ensure all machines can communicate. On a machine like `CLIENT1A`, open Command Prompt and try to `ping` the IP addresses of every other machine in the lab (`SERVER1A`, `SERVER1B`, `ROUTERVM`, `SERVER2A`, and `CLIENT2A`). If all pings are successful, your network routing is working correctly.

* **Test Internet Connectivity**: A basic check to ensure all machines can reach the outside world.

    * We successfully pinged a public internet IP (`8.8.8.8`).

    * We were able to browse the internet from all machines.

* **Test DNS Resolution**: A test to ensure our domain controllers are working.

    * `nslookup znsession.com` correctly found our domain controllers.

This confirmed that our entire virtual network was running perfectly, and our servers were all in their correct roles. Our lab is now complete and ready for the next steps!

#### **Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues**

If you find that the machines are not able to ping each other or access the internet, here are some common issues and troubleshooting steps:

* **Ping Failures**: If you can't ping between machines, the issue is often a firewall.

    * **Check Firewalls**: Ensure that the Windows Defender Firewall is either disabled for testing purposes or has an inbound rule to allow ICMP (ping) traffic, as detailed in **Phase 4, Problem 2**.

    * **Verify IP Configuration**: Double-check the static IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways on all machines to ensure they are correct for their respective networks (`WAN1` or `LAN2`).

* **No Internet Access**: If a machine can ping its gateway but cannot reach public IPs like `8.8.8.8`, the problem is likely with the router's configuration.

    * **Review RRAS Setup**: Revisit the steps in **Phase 4, Problem 1** to ensure the `ROUTERVM`'s RRAS configuration is correct. The `WAN1` network card must be set as the public interface with NAT enabled, and the `LAN2` network card must be set as a private interface.

* **DNS Resolution Issues**: If you can ping by IP address but not by domain name (e.g., `ping znsession.com` fails), the DNS settings are the most likely culprit.

    * **Check DNS Settings**: On all domain-joined machines (`SERVER2A`, `CLIENT1A`, `CLIENT2A`), make sure the preferred and alternate DNS servers are set to the IP addresses of `SERVER1A` (`192.168.132.130`) and `SERVER1B` (`192.168.132.131`).

### **7. Phase 5: Detailed Troubleshooting**

*Why we're doing this:* In real-world projects, things often don't work perfectly the first time. This section shows the problems we encountered and how we diagnosed and fixed them, which is a critical skill for anyone working in IT.

This was the most important phase. We encountered problems and had to carefully fix them to make the network work.

#### **Problem 1: `SERVER2A` could not connect to `SERVER1A` or the Internet**

* **The Issue**: Our first try at configuring RRAS didn't work. Traffic from `SERVER2A` couldn't get past `ROUTERVM` even though its IP addresses seemed correct. We later found out the router's network cards were incorrectly labeled.

* **The Fix**:

    1.  **On `ROUTERVM`**, open `Routing and Remote Access`.

    2.  In the left pane, expand `IPv4` > `NAT`.

    3.  Right-click the **`WAN1` interface** and select `Properties`.

    4.  On the `General` tab, make sure the box that says **`Public interface connected to the Internet`** is checked. Also, `Enable NAT on this interface` should be checked.

    5.  Now, find the **`LAN2` interface** and right-click it, then select `Properties`.

    6.  On the `General` tab, make sure the box that says **`Private interface connected to private network`** is checked. `Enable NAT on this interface` should be **unchecked**.

    7.  Finally, we right-clicked `ROUTERVM (local)` at the top of the menu and chose `All Tasks` > `Restart` to apply the changes.

#### **Problem 2: One-way Ping Issue (Router couldn't ping Server)**

* **The Issue**: After fixing the router, `SERVER2A` could finally connect to everything. However, when we tried to ping `SERVER2A` *from* `ROUTERVM`, it didn't work. This meant `SERVER2A`'s firewall was blocking pings from the router.

* **The Fix**: We needed to create a new firewall rule on `SERVER2A` to allow pings.

    1.  **On `SERVER2A`**, open `Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security` (you can search for it in the Start Menu).

    2.  In the left pane, click on `Inbound Rules`.

    3.  In the right pane, click `New Rule...`.

    4.  In the wizard, follow these steps:

        * **Rule Type**: Choose `Custom`.

        * **Program**: Choose `All programs`.

        * **Protocol and Ports**: Set `Protocol type` to `ICMPv4`. Click the `Customize` button, select `Specific ICMP types`, and check the box for `Echo Request (Type 8, Code 0)`.

        * **Scope**: Leave both IP address sections set to `Any IP address`.

        * **Action**: Choose `Allow the connection`.

        * **Profile**: Make sure all three boxes (`Domain`, `Private`, and `Public`) are checked.

        * **Name**: Give the rule a clear name like `Allow Ping Inbound`.

        * Click `Finish`.
